Routemaps to different locations in NYC with wide enough sidewalks for physical distancing:
Keeping physical distance is a challenge in times of pandemic/disease. 
This project will be especially useful for people looking to avoid narrow or crowded sidewalks in large cities. 
Even in normal times, this can be used to recommend paths to walk your dog on, or go on walks in pairs/groups without hassle. 
The ideal application would suggest an optimum route for a certain number of people, with options for dog walking/physical distancing. 
Details regarding the number of recommended people for each street sidewalk may be available upon zooming in. 
Additional details regarding the safety (no of street lamps, higher rated restaurants can be used to quantify) may be added to the application later.

For the moment, I have attempted to visualize the effective width(area/length) of different features, and attempted to cluster them into groups.
This will enable the routing algorithm to choose from different clusters depending on the user settings and information.
